        ### Description
        
        A simple program that facilitates the downloading of course materials hosted on Canvas Online Learning Platform.  Using Google Chrome (chromedriver) or Firefox (geckodriver), either with or without GUI, after logging-in, it will traverse your courses, finding video links and download them as videos you can watch off-line or mp3 for you to listen on the go.
        
        ### Installation
        
        To install the library, run:
        
        pip3 install canvasscraper
        
        
        ### Configuration
        
        Then either call it in your code like so:
        
        from canvasscraper.fileops import XXXX
        from canvasscraper.objects import XXXX
        
        Or run it as a CLI program using (coming soon):
        
        -b broswer
        -gui is flagged will show browser as functions
        -up username password
        -sch school subdomain asu by default
        
        
        There will options for the output directory structure, saving of URL list, potentially saving of slide, and 
        maybe even page text saved to file.
